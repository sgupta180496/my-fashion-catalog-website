	"name": "Boy Chanel Handbag",
	"brand": "Chanel",
	"description": "The Boy Bag was inspired by Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel’s tendency to play with masculine accent in her style. Karl Lagerfeld described it as such, “Chanel used men’s underwear to make dresses; she has a boyish attitude, in fact it is the very spirit of Chanel. She got it from Boy Capel, the greatest love of her life, which, incidentally, explains why the new bag is called the Boy Chanel.” However, the Boy Bag isn’t overwhelmingly masculine as one would suspect, although it does feature a distinctive utilitarian feel in comparison with the very feminine classic flap. The structure of the Boy Bag is boxier with straight lines and angular corners, making it look like a modern version of the Chanel Classic flap. It is the perfect blend of the chic timelessness associated with all Chanel bags and the boldness that Chanel is well known for. The large front flap on the Boy Bag is one of the main features and allows Chanel to embellish a range of designs that they don’t have the space for on classic bags. This allows the Boy Bag to evolve season on season, with changes to designs, styles, and materials occurring regularly. In fact, the possibilities when designing a Boy Bag are endless and this is one of the main attractions for collectors and Chanel lovers. Add to this the functionality and versatility of the bag and it is clearly a winner. It can be worn over the shoulder or across the body, as a casual or a formal bag, and features enough interior space to fit in all your essentials.",
